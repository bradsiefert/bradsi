Blue Box is a fantastic idea. A concierge, Uber-like service for all of the stuff that you don't need in your life at any particular time. A wonderful idea for urban dwellers like we Chicagoans. This is a design that unfortunately hit the cutting room floor, but one that I am still very proud of. I think the service solves a very real problem and creating a fluid UX for a user dashboard actually proved to be more tricky than one would think at first glance. These logo mockups were replaced, but will live here instead. I'm very proud of these designs and I only wish they were out in the world longer.
