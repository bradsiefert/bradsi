Design systems have become a powerful way that designers can create consistent, well managed web and mobile apps. I've been toying around with making my own design system for a while and I wanted to show a bit of a preview to what I've been working on.

This design system is based on Bootstrap 4, but with lots of personal tweaks and additions. I've never been happy with the spacing options in Bootstrap so I've tweaked them to make a bit more sense to me. These colors and type tweaks I think are a bit better as well. One of the major changes is with typography. I'm using Inter for the body and headings and IBM Plex Mono for code, tables, and buttons. I think they compliment each other very well. I find myself making many of these changes whenever I create a new site so hopefully this will be a better starting place for my firm and others.
